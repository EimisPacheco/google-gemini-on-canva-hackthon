### Summary
I was inspired to create two innovative apps, Wizard Designer Pal and Wizard Magic Tower, as a business case for Canva, recognizing a gap in their marketplace for tools that blend creativity with AI-driven functionality. Canva, known for its user-friendly design tools, currently lacks apps that deeply integrate generative AI to simplify complex design tasks, and I aimed to fill that void.

Wizard Designer Pal: serves as a personal design assistant, particularly for those new to graphic design or keen on learning more. The app uses the Gemini API to offer advanced features like color theory guidance, accessibility checks (including color blindness simulation), and AI-driven background recommendations. The Gemini APIâ€™s multimodal capabilities allow the app to perform detailed image analyses and generate accurate textual descriptions, ensuring that designs are not only aesthetically pleasing but also inclusive and accessible.

Wizard Magic Tower, on the other hand, is a powerful tool for graphic designers who want to add a touch of magic to their work. This app allows users to create and modify backgrounds, add unique frames, and generate AI-driven image variations, among other creative tasks. Itâ€™s like having a personal design wizard at your fingertips. The Gemini API plays a crucial role here as well, enabling the generation of high-quality images based on text prompts and enhancing the appâ€™s ability to create complex visual elements with ease.

### Inspiration 

I was inspired to create Wizard Designer Pal because I wanted to build a tool that could serve as a personal design assistant for graphic designers, especially those who are just starting out or eager to learn. I saw a need for an app that could not only help with basic design principles, like color theory, but also provide advanced features like accessibility checks and color blindness simulation. From my own experience, I know that some companies place great importance on making designs accessible to people with color blindness, and I wanted to incorporate that into this app.


### What it does

Wizard Designer Pal is an app that works with generative AI to assist graphic designers in various aspects of their work. It offers a range of functionalities, but its main purpose is to serve as a personal design assistant. Users can ask questions about color theory and other best practices in graphic design. The app also performs quality checks on images, provides image descriptions, and evaluates the designâ€™s accessibilityâ€”particularly how it would look to people with different types of color blindness. 

Additionally, it offers image background recommendations

### How I built it

I built Wizard Designer Pal using a combination of Canva SDK, React, Node.js, Javascript and and TypeScript in the backend. These technologies were new to me, which made the process both challenging and rewarding. I spent a lot of time learning the ins and outs of these languages and frameworks, which allowed me to create a robust and user-friendly app. The integration of generative AI for tasks like image variation and background recommendation required careful planning and implementation, but the end result was worth the effort.

Prompt engineering was key to the success of the project in achieving the desired results

### **Potential Impact:**
How big of an impact could the project have on Canvaâ€™s users or a third party productâ€™s users? Does it fill a major gap in the product? Is this something users have been asking for?

**Anwer:**  Having a design assistant will encourage more people without design experience to use Canvaâ€™s platform even more. This app has the potential to attract more customers, as theyâ€™ll feel extra motivated to create and learn with guidance from an expert in the field. This is why it would be a valuable addition.

Incorporating features like design accessibility and color blindness simulation will be important for companies like the one I previously worked for, as they prioritize these aspects.

###  **Quality of the Idea:**
How creative and unique is the project? Does the concept exist already? If so, how much does the project improve on it?

**Anwer:** I reviewed the current Canva apps and found that none were quite like mine. I noticed that Canva currently lacks a design assistant to guide users through the design process. This is particularly important for people like me who don't have a design background, new designers who are still learning, and even experienced designers who want to continue improving their skills.

Additionally, my app includes a feature that determines if a design is accessible to everyone. Unlike other apps, it specifically focuses on being inclusive for people with color blindness. My app even include a color blindness simulator. The color simulation feature enables designers to visualize how their design would look to people with different types of color blindness.

My app includes background recomendations and image variation where a new image will be generated based on the description of the current image.

Although there are AI-powered apps out there, mine stands out due to its specialized focus. Instead of just generating AI images like the more generic options, my app leverages AI alongside JavaScript capabilities and existing Canva's components to make this Designer assistant possible.

Without any doubt my app is original and unique! 


### Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Iâ€™m particularly proud of the color blindness simulation feature. Knowing that some companies, based on my own experience, are keen on making their designs accessible to people with color blindness, I felt it was crucial to include this in the app. Additionally, the image background recommendation feature turned out to be more sophisticated than I initially expected, providing users with valuable insights that can enhance their designs. Overall, Iâ€™m proud of how I was able to learn new technologies and successfully implement features that can genuinely help designers.


### What I learned

Throughout this project, I learned a great deal about Canva SDK, React, Node.js, and TypeScript. These technologies were challenging for me, but tackling them head-on has expanded my skill set and made me more versatile as a developer. I also gained a deeper understanding of the importance of accessibility in design, especially for users with color blindness. This project reinforced the idea that designing with inclusivity in mind not only broadens your audience but also creates better, more thoughtful work.


### What's next for Wizard Designer Pal

Looking ahead, I plan to continue improving Wizard Designer Pal by adding more features that cater to both novice and experienced designers. I want to refine the existing functionalities, especially the AI-driven recommendations and accessibility checks. Additionally, Iâ€™m considering expanding the app to support more types of design work, such as UX/UI design and possibly even 3D modeling. The goal is to make Wizard Designer Pal a comprehensive tool that can assist designers in every aspect of their creative process.

### How I built it

I am using gemini-1.5-flash for text generation, gemini-1.5-pro for computer vision and imagen-3.0-generate-001 for image generation.


Building **Wizard Magic Tower** was an exciting journey. I used a combination of Canva SDK, React, Javascript, Node.js, and TypeScript in the backend. These were challenging for me since I donâ€™t typically work with these programming languages, but I was determined to learn and push through. The appâ€™s core functions revolve around the generative AI capabilities, which allow users to perform all kinds of creative tasks with just a few clicks. Integrating these technologies and ensuring they worked seamlessly together was both challenging and rewarding.

In the demo. I'm using a very short prompt, but the more detailed your prompts, the better the results you'll get. You don't need to create perfect prompts because, behind the scenes, the original prompt is sent to Gemini Flash Text Generation, which refines it before it's sent to the Gemini Image Generation. This ensures your prompts are always optimized for the best results.
